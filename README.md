An Anki 2.1 addon that takes a video file and breaks it up into frames.

Cards are created using the frames. The front is the frame and the back is the title of the video file.

If you're on Linux, you'll need to ensure you have MPV installed. Windows users should be fine as a copy of MPV is included with Anki 2.1.

Currently, you need to have the 'Basic' note type, which you should unless you've deleted it for some reason. Also, cards go to the default deck. Both of these little things will change.
